# Questions about Problems and Recipes



[TB Chapter 2, Problem 1]
* Question (yxie18-stat697): Is there difference between the conditional operator IS NULL and IS MISSING?



[TB Chapter 2, Problem 2]
* Question (yxie18-stat697): As for LIKE operator, can space also be regarded as one character when using the special character % with the LIKE operator?
- Answer (yxie18-stat697): According to the example on Page 38, I think so.



[TB Chapter 2, Problem 3]
* Question (yxie18-stat697): As I have been wondering about the difference between the WHERE clause and HAVING clause, and I noticed that it's said in the TB that WHERE clause is processed before SELECT clause. Is it also a consideration when thinking about whether to put the condition statement in the WHERE clause or in the HAVING clause?



[TB Chapter 2, Problem 4]
* Question (yxie18-stat697): When using CALCULATED keyword in the FROM clause, will second pass through the whole query still happen?
- Answer (yxie18-stat697): Per my understanding on what's said on Page 60 and 61ï¼Œ I think data remerging won't happen under this situation.



[TB Chapter 2, Problem 5]
* Question (yxie18-stat697): As summary function, could count(*) and count(column) be used interchangably?



[TB Chapter 2, Problem 6]
* Question (yxie18-stat697): What's the difference between HAVING and WHERE clause?
- Answer (yxie18-stat697): HAVING goes with GROUP BY, WHERE goes with FROM; can use summary functions in HAVING but cannot use them with WHERE clause; need to specify the keyword CALCULATED in a WHERE clause while don't have to do it for HAVING clause.



[TB Chapter 3, Problem 7]
* Question (yxie18-stat697): What would happen, if in the Example: Technique 2 on the Page 113, the Sasuser.Staffmaster table was not assigned with different alias each time it was read?



[combine-data-at-different-grains SAS Recipe]
* Question (yxie18-stat697): Why do we have to specify the out and method in the PROC HTTP procedure?



[combine-data-at-different-grains Python Recipe]
* Question (yxie18-stat697): Why do we need to reset index for zipcode_agg_by_statename_df? Is it the same thing with appending a new row with index?
